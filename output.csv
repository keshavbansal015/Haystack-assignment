"April 10, 2021",Verified purchase,5,Refreshing and trustworthy,"Name brand that has been known in the cleaning industry for years. These wipes are a good size, and come out of the container without rubbing or tearing on a rough plastic like the less expensive brands. They are easily torn apart on taking out of the container, where as some other brands many cloths are wasted because 3-5 come out at once. There is a nice, refreshing scent without being too harsh and abrasive. Also, the individual cloths are moist so you know you are getting some cleaner with them. Most other brands come out dry. I've even had to pour more cleaner in half used containers of other brands directly over the cloths because they were dried out. Waste of money. During this time of Covid we have depended on these and had a container in almost every room, as well as the car. We simply trust them. And, will continue to have available in our home long after we get back to ""normal"".",TRP,

"April 7, 2021",Verified purchase,1,Poor packaging for the Clorox disinfecting wipes,"I just received this order delivery today and I have to tell you that Im so disappointed with regard to the packaging. The box was wet on one side and I could smell the strong contents of the Clorox disinfecting wipes coming from the inside! I had not opened the box at that point but the smell was so strong so you can imagine once I did open the contents! Paper was inserted into the box but there was no other type of wrapping other than what the item came with. The contents was soaked and two of the containers lids were slightly opened! Liquid was all over, it was a huge mess!! Needless to say I will not be ordering this item from Walmart in the future! With COVID-19 in effect and being handicapped I thought ordering any product would be safe not to mention convenient, but little did I know I was wrong!! I have ordered laundry soap liquid as well as other types of liquids and have not experienced this issue! Not happy with this at all.
